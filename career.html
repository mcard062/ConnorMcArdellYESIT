        <h3>Why I’m Interested</h3>
        <p>
          ALLETE offers business, strategy, and operations internships that give real experience with budgeting, market research, and corporate planning. Because I’m studying Entrepreneurship, I like that this environment shows how large companies evaluate new markets and manage big projects — skills that translate directly into launching or managing a venture.
        </p>

        <h3>Why I’m Qualified</h3>
        <p>
          At UMD, I’ve done business-planning, financial modeling, and market analysis projects. I understand how to break down customer needs, size markets, and present findings clearly. I also work well in team settings and can pick things up quickly.
        </p>

        <h3>How My Skills Fit Their Needs</h3>
        <p>
          My market-research and business-planning experience supports their business development and analytics teams. My finance coursework aligns with the budgeting and forecasting work they often assign to interns, and my communication skills help with presenting insights to cross-functional groups.
