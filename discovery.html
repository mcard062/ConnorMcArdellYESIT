                <h2>Why I Chose UMD</h2>
                <p>
                    I chose to go to the University of Minnesota Duluth mostly because I already lived up here in Duluth, but there are more reasons. For starters Duluth is beautiful, there is so much to do outdoors from hikes to swimming or just looking at scenery. UMD is also great, I had experience here from the two years of PSEO I did in High School. UMD also has a great buisness school so that was one of the factors as well.

                <h2>What I Like About Duluth</h2>
                <p>
                    What I like about Duluth the most is the skiing. I try to go to Spirit Mountain once a week to go ski. I also love Lake Superior. Taking the boat out is so nice in the summer time. One place that I go to a lot is Enger Tower on top of the hill. It has the most amazing view of the city and the awesome Lake Superior. There is so much to do in Duluth.

                <h2>Personal Experiences & Campus Highlights</h2>
                <p>
                    One of my highlights on campus was going through the hiking trails there. Whenever I am bored or bomb a test it is nice to go for a walk through the woods. My personal experiences at UMD have been great. I have had some amazing professors that had an impact on me. It truly is a great school.
